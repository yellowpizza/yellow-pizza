<p>Yellow Pizza offers pizza made with fresh ingredients for 
    taste. This delightful pizzeria was made by Oliver, 
    who has experience making Pizza for over 30 years in New York at 
    Yellow Pizza. 
     The rich flavor of freshly bought tomatoes, olives,
    and cheese make for a perfect pizza. 
</p>
<p>Whether you are looking for a quick pizza lunch, or looking to
    bring your family and have a good time, we have the pizza for you.
    Stop by at our New York location, or visit our other locations throughout
    the states. Be sure to try all of our amazing flavors. You can 
    also build your own pizza!
    We are open from Tuesdays to Thursdays, 12PM to 8PM.</p>
